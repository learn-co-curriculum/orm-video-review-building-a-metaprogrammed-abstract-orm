# Building a Metaprogrammed Abstract ORM- Overview
This video reviews the ways to create objects and their attributes from a database using Ruby and SQL. You will learn how to build the necessary methods needed to extract data from a database and instantiate and save instances of a class using said data. Additionally, you will learn how to build methods that update a database. These methods are built out for a specific class. This lesson covers the logic and mechanics of abstracting each method so that, collectively, they can be applied to any class.

## How You Can Help Us Make These Videos Better

### Suggest Learning Objectives That We Can Add

As you watch the video, think about what the student is able to do at the end of it. What are the different steps and processes they'll know? Help us out by including individual learning objectives. As a general rule, here's the format that we use to write objectives.

Action Verb + Task or Object + Specific Conditions or Criteria we use when performing that action

So for example. here's a good learning objective:

- Use the `gets` method to capture, store, and operate on input

Our action verb in this case is "Use." The verb then acts on the `gets` method. But what specifically do we want students to use the `get` method for? That's where the specific condition of "to capture, store, and operate on input" comes in.

### How to Add a Summary or Objectives

There are two ways that you can do this. First, you can simply raise an issue (find the flag icon at the top right side of your lesson page) in Learn and title it either "Suggested Summary" or "Suggested Objectives" or if you want to be amazing and do both, then title it "Suggested Summary and Objectives."  In the body of the issue, write your suggestions, submit it, and you're done!

You can also edit the lesson (find the paper and pen icon at the top right side of your lesson page) in Learn. And once you click that you'll be able to add and submit your edits!
